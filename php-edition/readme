Hello!

Here you'll find most of the code broken out into examples rather than code
listings. Many of the examples from the book are iterative and we felt that 
a source download only made sense in this format.

You should unpack this into the root of your experimental site, put your API
key in the apikey.php file inthe root and fill in your database credentials
in the db_credentials.php file. If you're not operating from the root then
you'll need to make some minor changes to the way these two file are included
in the scripts.

Also, for some examples you'll still need to download the raw data that makes
the code go. The BlueMarble example from chapter 7 is the best example of this
as it requires a very large download and would not compress sufficiently to
include directly in this archive.

We hope these examples serve you well as a foundation upon which you build your
own projects. Please let us know if you build something cool!

Enjoy!

Cam Turner, Jeffrey Sambells & Mike Purvis.
